                <p>An online photo album is a virtual space that opens a window into the past and unites the community. This project is a unique means of preserving and sharing memories, creating a digital archive of events and emotions.</p>
                <p>Preservation of Moments: The online photo album provides the opportunity to preserve and share life's most important moments. From the first steps to graduation, each snapshot becomes a part of one's own story.</p>
                <p>Community and Relationships: Photos bring people together. The online photo album allows for the creation of shared albums where all participants can add their photos and mark shared moments, emphasizing the significance of relationships and shared experiences.</p>
                <p>Convenient Access: Thanks to the online format, the photo album is accessible anytime and from any device. This makes it a convenient tool for viewing and editing, even in large groups.</p>
                <p>Individual Choice: Each user can personally manage their photo album, deciding which photos to add and who has access to view and comment.</p>
